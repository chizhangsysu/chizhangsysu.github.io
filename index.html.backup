                During my PhD program, I served as a research intern at
                Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), with a focus on Stereo Matching
                and
                Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). After graduating
                in
                2017, I co-founded DeepMotion, an autonomous driving startup. At
                DeepMotion, I had the opportunity to build a sophisticated HD
                mapping system from the ground up, as well as a self-driving
                system
                capable of navigating complex urban scenarios. In 2021,
                and since then, I have been leading
                Xiaomi's Urban Planning and Control (PnC) Team, as well as the
                Simulation Team.

                I also lead the Simulation team at Xiaomi. Our work involves
                building three primary tools: a road test log replayer, a
                simulator, and
                an evaluation system, whose final goal is to drive the iteration
                of the full
                algorithm stack.
                The log replayer is capable of displaying a wide
                array of multimodal information, as well as supporting a wide
                range of user
                interactions. Most often, a developer can pinpoint the root
                cause of an
                issue by simply replaying the log.
                Our simulator ensures deterministic behavior and
                strong result consistency between road tests and simulations. It
                supports two modes commonly used in the industry: "worldsim" for
                manually created traffic scenarios and "logsim" for reproducing
                traffic from recorded logs, both with intelligent agent behavior
                support.
                The evaluation system provides a comprehensive set of
                built-in metrics. These can, through thoughtful design, be
                ultimately represented
                as some functions of spatial polygons, time intervals, scalar
                ranges, and
                enum ranges, enabling automatic and trustworthy case-by-case
                evaluation. Leveraging cluster computing, we can automatically
                evaluate thousands of cases in daily fashion, offering timely
                feedback
                for rapid algorithm iteration.
